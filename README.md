# Bible-Bowl-Buzzers
Wiring, CAD, and code to build your own set of lockout buzzers.\
This was designed by EEOC Engineering with National Bible Bowl in mind.\
It incorporates as much of the functionality of Steve Kirkman's system as possible.\
Nearly all functionality is in code and CAD, so this design is extremely versatile.\
